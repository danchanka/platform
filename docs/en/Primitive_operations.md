Primitive operators include operators for working with properties which values belong to the built-in classes. The platform supports the following primitive operators:

-   [Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /)](Arithmetic_operators_+_-_..._.md)
-   [Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)](Logical_operators_AND_OR_NOT_XOR_.md)
-   [Comparison operators (==, \>, <, LIKE)](Comparison_operators_=_..._.md)
-   [String operators (+, CONCAT, SUBSTRING)](String_operators_+_CONCAT_SUBSTRING_.md)
-   [Structure operators (STRUCT, \[\])](Structure_operations_STRUCT_.md)
-   [Custom formula (FORMULA)](Custom_formula_FORMULA_.md)
-   [Type conversion](Type_conversion.md)
