System state change operators include the following.

-   [Property change (CHANGE)](Property_change_CHANGE_.md)
-   [New object (NEW)](New_object_NEW_.md)
-   [Class change (DELETE / CHANGECLASS)](Class_change_CHANGECLASS_DELETE_.md)

In this case, we are talking about the state of the system in which the created action is executed. Interaction with external systems is included in the [user interaction](User_IS_interaction.md) section.
