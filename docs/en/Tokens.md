title: 'Tokens'
---

A *token* in a programming language is the smallest significant sequence of characters. In the **lsFusion **language tokens are keywords, [IDs](IDs.md), [literals](Literals.md) and special character sequences.

Tokens are usually separated by *delimiters* (spaces, line breaks, tabs), but separators can be omitted in cases where ambiguity does not occur.

### Examples

|Keywords|<strong>CLASS</strong>, <strong>FORM</strong>, <strong>DATA</strong>, <strong>IF</strong>, <strong>INTEGER</strong>|
|---|---|
|IDs|System, base, Object, incomeDocument|
|Literals|5, 1.25, 'Text String', #FF00FF, 1982_07_13|
|Special characters|:, ->, !=, (+), ###|
